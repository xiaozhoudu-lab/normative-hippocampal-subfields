## 1. Introduction

This repository provides scripts for constructing **hippocampal subfield normative models** using *Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS)* and for applying these models to diverse clinical tasks, including disease classification, cognitive prediction, and prognosis stratification.

The repository includes:

* **Example datasets** for normative model fitting, calibration, and validation.
* **Trained normative models (RDS files)** that can be requested from the authors.
* **Scripts** for each stage of the analytical workflow.
* **Example outputs** for reference and validation.

---

## 2. Datasets

Example datasets are provided solely for demonstration and code testing purposes.
They include small synthetic samples that mimic the format of the original datasets.
These examples are **not suitable for scientific analyses**.

The full multi-center datasets used in published studies cannot be shared publicly due to data-use restrictions.
Researchers interested in collaboration or access to the trained normative models should contact the authors directly via email.

---

## 3. Models

The pre-trained **GAMLSS-based normative models** for hippocampal subfield volumes are available as `.rds` files.
These models can be applied to new subjects or cohorts to derive age-, sex-, and site-adjusted deviation scores (Z-scores and centiles).

> ðŸ”¹ **Note:**
> The complete RDS model files are not included in this repository due to data-sharing policies.
> Researchers can request access by contacting the corresponding author via email.

## 4. Scripts

The repository contains a complete, modular workflow for normative modeling and clinical applications.

### 4.1 Required R packages and installation

**`Check-and-install-packages.R`**
Automatically checks and installs all necessary R packages required for modeling, application, and visualization.

---

### 4.2 Normative curve estimation and peak age determination

**`Normative-model-fit.R`**
Fits normative lifespan models using GAMLSS based on hippocampal subfield volumes, estimates peak ages, and generates normative trajectories.

---

### 4.3 Bootstrap analysis of normative curves

**`Bootstrap-normative-mdoel-fit.R`**
Performs bootstrap resampling (default 1,000 iterations) to estimate confidence intervals for normative trajectories and peak ages.

---

### 4.4 ICV adjustment and model comparison

**`ICV.R`**
Implements intracranial volume (ICV)â€“adjusted normative models and evaluates consistency between adjusted and non-adjusted trajectories using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC).

---

### 4.5 Model calibration using new datasets

**`Calibration-normative-model-using-new-dataset.R`**
Applies a recalibration procedure to adapt pre-trained normative models to new sites or scanners using control subjects.

---

### 4.6 Applying normative models to disease datasets

**`Disease-application-normative-model.R`**
Applies the trained normative models to multi-disease datasets to compute deviation scores (Z-scores and centiles) for each patient across all hippocampal subfields.

---

### 4.7 Applying normative models to individual-level data

**`Individual-application-normative-model.R`**
Computes deviation scores for a single individual or small cohort based on pre-trained normative models, enabling personalized brain health assessments.

---

### 4.8 Statistical analyses of deviation scores across diseases

**`Stastical-analysis-deviations-across-diseases.R`**
Performs Monte Carlo permutation tests for group-level comparisons between diseases and matched controls, estimating p-values and effect sizes (Cohenâ€™s d) with FDR correction.

---

### 4.9 Clinical downstream tasks

**`ROC&DPS.R`**
Performs ROC analyses and computes disease propensity scores (DPS) using SVM-based classification of deviation profiles.

**`associations_centile_scores_cognition.R`**
Examines correlations between hippocampal centile scores and cognitive measures (partial Spearman correlation, FDR-corrected).

**`cognitive-score-prediciton.R`**
Uses multivariate SVR (RBF kernel) to predict cognitive performance from centile scores.

**`HC&MCI-risk-stratificaiton.R`**
Conducts longitudinal survival analysis to predict conversion from healthy control (HC) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and from MCI to Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD).

**`MS-Prognosis-risk-stratificaiton.R`**
Builds prognostic models for multiple sclerosis (MS) progression using LASSOâ€“Cox regression and Kaplanâ€“Meier survival analysis.

**`DBS.R`**
Implements an SVM classifier to identify responders vs. non-responders to deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment in Parkinsonâ€™s disease.
